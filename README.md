# Bafup
Bafup which stands for "Back All Files Up" is a platform where users can import anything at all; phone contacts, videos, audios, documents, images, scripts, browser bookmarks, saved pages.   I know, Google Backup is prolly doing this or similar already, but the outstanding difference here is, Bafup gives the ability for users to share links of imported contents to anyone for access; that means I could upload my contacts to the platform and get a link I could use to access my contacts and download them too without having to login. I could as well share this link to anyone I want to have access to my phone book contacts. This applies to every other files.
